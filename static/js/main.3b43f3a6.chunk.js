The Protection spells, like Protection from Evil and Good, are perfect counters to specific combats, and thus critical for a highly prepared magic user. Counterspell and Dispel Magic are both important for destroying powerful magic from bosses or dangerous creatures. Banishment is a unique spell that takes an enemy entirely out of combat for a while, which is great for isolating important targets. Abjuration is a critical school for protecting your Wizard as well. Spells like Mage Armor and Shield will keep your AC high enough to block projectiles or melee attacks. You can also put those buffs on your allies to keep them in front of you long enough to weave your spells! Against dragons, spells like Protection from Energy can absorb a ton of damage, enough to keep you alive for a long time. There are a ton of other abjuration spells, though!

Important spells from this school include the Summoning spells tree, Entangling effects, Teleportation, and a wide variety of damaging effects. Summons are creatures that the caster controls that join combat for a limited amount of time. They are perfect for soaking up damage or even dealing a lot of it! Entangling spells, like Entangle or Web, will help you control combat. There are actually a pretty decent number of Conjuration spells that are specifically for combat control! Teleportation is critical in late game Dungeons & Dragons, and to get there you need to learn some Conjuration magic. Dimension Door, Misty Step, and Teleportation are great spells in this category. Finally, there\u2019s a wide variety of just hard damage magic that you can look forward to! These spells don\u2019t tend to be massive explosions, but there are areas of effect like Cloud of Daggers or Cloudkill that allow you to chase opponents. This school has a ton of Concentration effects; they\u2019re efficient uses of spell slots, but might not always do great burst damage right off the bat.

Some important spells here include the Detect spells, Clairvoyance, the Augury effects, and the Language effects. Detect spells are really strong, allowing you to find magic where it is otherwise invisible (or even finding creatures that are invisible!). Clairvoyance (and spells like Arcane Eye or Locate Creature) are good for scouting specific locations or people to ensure they are safe. Augury and Commune, as well as other effects like them, allow the player to gain some level of insight from their DM. This can be useful for mediating party conflicts. Language spells, like Comprehend Languages and Tongues, might help you perform diplomacy where it was otherwise impossible.

The range of Enchantment varies drastically; from a simple Charm to Frighten, to outright mental control. You may recognize spells like Dominate Person, Charm Person, Enthrall, Hex, Hold Person, and Modify Memory. These are all very strong Enchantment spells. Enchantment also has a somewhat more niche purpose; buffs. Spells like Bless, Heroism, and Motivational Speech cause your allies to work harder, ignore pain, and do more.

Standouts of this school include the classic Area of Effect spells; Fireball, Lighting Bolt, Earthquake, Thunderwave, and plenty more. These spells are super important for taking down groups of enemies, something that most melee or martial classes have trouble doing. You can clear out rooms really fast by spending spell slots on Evocation spells. Evocation is also used for some single-target effects. Things like Chromatic Orb, Divine Word, the Power Word series, Magic Missile\u2026 These and a ton more are specifically for removing a singular target from the fight as soon as possible. They do more burst damage than spells like Spiritual Weapon, but they tend to not do damage for more than one turn. However, did you know that healing magic is Evocation? That\u2019s right; Cure Wounds, Heal, and Healing Word are all Evocation spells. That means your standard Cleric or Bard will be slinging loads of healing magic, and preparing to counter evocation might mean stopping a healer from doing their work.

Illusions change the senses of the target, convincing them that there\u2019s something there that is not truly there. It is by far the most DM-dependant school; Illusion can be easily ignored if it is not played into! But, a good illusionist can cause an army to surrender. Knowing your illusion magic can save your skin, or at least save you from missing treasure. Illusion magic is basically split into two categories; Creative Illusions and Mechanical Illusions. Creative Illusions are spells that require you to craft them individually, and thus are stronger the more applicable they are to the situation. Spells like Creation, Disguise Self, Illusory Script, and the Major Image Tree are all in this category. As you become better and better at D&D, and as long as your DM is willing to play along, these spells will be really fun, and potentially very strong. Great at problem solving, at least! Mechanical Illusions have set effects and DCs, which means they are more akin to the other schools of magic. These spells include Blink and Invisibility, buffs that are insanely strong and help you survive for a long time. Spells like Color Spray allow you to distract enemies with a DC, potentially incapacitating them if it\u2019s early enough. However, Illusions also have damage effects. Illusory Dragon is an illusory Area of Effect, Mental Prison deals Psychic damage and incapacitates someone, and Shadow Sword just deals good damage.

Rather than sticking to combat control and damage, like Conjuration and Evocation, Necromancy does a wide variety of effects. A true Necromancer allies themselves with the dead, but any Necromancy magic relies on a living (or formally living) being to work. Some notable necromancy magic include some of the damaging spells. Spells like Enervation, Finger of Death, Harm, and Vampiric Touch harm your enemies, but tend to have another effect attached. Finger of Death, for instance, deals a massive amount of damage, but requires you to land an attack roll and for them to fail a save. Vampiric Touch heals the caster, letting you deal damage while keeping yourself alive. Necromancy is also a great debuffing school, with powerful spells like Blight, Contagion, and Ray of Sickness. These are not necessarily as brutal as the debuffs from Enchantment, but they deal a bit of damage on the way, and can be a more direct inhibitor to the enemy\u2019s ability to attack you. Necromancy is also a summoning school, in more ways than one! You can summon skeletons or spirits using Necromancy and build an undead army. Or, you use Necromancy to bring party members back to life. That means that every Cleric should have a tiny bit of Necromancy in their spell repertoire! Necromancy has a ton of different magical effects, but they all have to deal with Necrotic damage, or some way of inhibiting the opponent. This is the de facto school of Necromancers and Liches.

Transmutation\u2019s best quality comes from buffs. This is the school where very strong buffs, like Fly and Haste, come from. These spells (among others), when spread around your party, will help increase durability and damage. While you won\u2019t be dealing damage specifically, the problem solving of your other party members will increase far beyond what is normal for their class! That doesn\u2019t mean that Transmutation is without damage. While it is sub-par at damage, spells like Dragon Breath, Cordon of Arrows, and Heat Metal all have their uses. And all players remember their first encounter with a Disintegrate spell. If you want to deal damage, Transmutation can sometimes be absolutely devastating. If that wasn\u2019t quite enough, the school also has some debuffs and status effects. Flesh to Stone can instantly end a fight, if the target fails their saving throw. Polymorph and Mass Polymorph can completely ruin a group of enemies, allowing you to choose who you target. Transmutation has utility spells as well; a ton of the Shape magic, like Shape Water or Move Earth, can allow you to skip entire portions of dungeons.
